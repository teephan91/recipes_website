# recipes_website
## About
A simple recipes website that has a main index page. The index page will then link to three internal pages/recipes.

## Technology Used
HTML

## What I Did
With this project, I learned to familiarize myself with the HTML boilerplate and practice using some popular HTML tags. I was able to create headings, paragraphs, and a few unordered and ordered lists. I also learned to include image on my page as well as link to other pages, both internally and externally.

This project also allowed me to hone my skills with the CLI, from navigating through my folders to creating directories and files. In fact, I feel more confident now using the Terminal app on my Mac. I rely less on the GUI and I'm starting to appreciate the CLI more. It can be ruthless in executing commands, but it teaches you to be precise and think twice before you act.

Lastly, this project walked me through the process of committing changes to Github. 

- I learned that atomic commits are important. Only commit when you make changes to *one* thing. By doing this, it creates a clear and one-step-at-a-time log of what has happened to your project. As a result, it helps you to keep track and pin point to a specific change when problems arise.
- I learned to write a proper commit message, with a correct subject line and a succinct body.

## What's Next?
The website is plain right now so adding some CSS styling would be the next logical step.
