## About
A simple recipes website that has a main index page. The index page will then link to three internal pages/recipes.

## What I Did
With this project, I learned to familiarize myself with the HTML boilerplate and practice using some popular HTML tags. I was able to create headings, paragraphs, and a few unordered and ordered lists. I also learned to include image on my page as well as link to other pages, both internally and externally.

This project also allowed me to hone my skills with the CLI, from navigating through my folders to creating directories and files. In fact, I feel more confident now using the Terminal app on my Mac. I rely less on the GUI and I'm starting to appreciate the CLI more. It can be ruthless in executing commands, but it teaches you to be precise and think twice before you act.

Next, this project walked me through the process of committing changes to Github. 

- I learned that atomic commits are important. Only commit when you make changes to *one* thing. By doing this, it creates a clear and one-step-at-a-time log of what has happened to your project. As a result, it helps you to keep track and pin point to a specific change when problems arise.
- I learned to write a correct commit message, with a proper subject line and a succinct body.

Lastly, I got a chance to practice styling HTML with CSS. 

- I started by creating an external style.css file and importing a few fonts to replace my browsers' default ones. After that, I moved on to style the element selectors that I used across all the HTML files. I then added classes to certain elements on a specific page to style them individually. I also grouped classes together to reduce repetition (if possible) in my CSS file. 
- Furthermore, I put the CSS rules into their own category, with a comment acting as a heading, so I know which rules are responsible for which page. For example, all the CSS rules that I used for the 1st recipe "Brisket" will be under /* Styling classes for brisket.html */. This was to help me look through the code with ease and monitor all the changes. 
- Speaking of changes, each time I finished making changes to a file, I committed it right away with a detailed message of what I did and why.

## Installation & Set Up
1. You have to fork this repo first. Github has a their own [step-by-step guide with pictures to follow along](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
- **Note**: You have the option of changing the name of your forked repo.
2. And to have all the files locally on your computer, open Terminal -> change the current directory to the directory you want to put this forked repo. Then, enter the command line below:
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/recipes_website.git
```
- **Note**: If you change the name of your forked repo, replace 'recipes_website.git' with '[your-forked-repo-name].git'. Github will automatically do this for you when you copy the link.
3. Finally, change to your new forked repo directory.
```
