# recipes_website
## About
A simple recipes website that has a main index page. The index page will then link to three internal pages/recipes.

## Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS

## What I Did
With this project, I learned to familiarize myself with the HTML boilerplate and practice using some popular HTML tags. I was able to create headings, paragraphs, and a few unordered and ordered lists. I also learned to include image on my page as well as link to other pages, both internally and externally.

This project also allowed me to hone my skills with the CLI, from navigating through my folders to creating directories and files. In fact, I feel more confident now using the Terminal app on my Mac. I rely less on the GUI and I'm starting to appreciate the CLI more. It can be ruthless in executing commands, but it teaches you to be precise and think twice before you act.

Next, this project walked me through the process of committing changes to Github. 

- I learned that atomic commits are important. Only commit when you make changes to *one* thing. By doing this, it creates a clear and one-step-at-a-time log of what has happened to your project. As a result, it helps you to keep track and pin point to a specific change when problems arise.
- I learned to write a correct commit message, with a proper subject line and a succinct body.

Lastly, I got a chance to practice styling HTML with CSS. 

- I started by creating an external style.css file and importing a few fonts to replace my browsers' default ones. After that, I moved on to style the element selectors that I used across all the HTML files. I then added classes to certain elements on a specific page to style them individually. I also grouped classes together to reduce repetition (if possible) in my CSS file. 
- Furthermore, I put the CSS rules into their own category, with a comment acting as a heading, so I know which rules are responsible for which page. For example, all the CSS rules that I used for the 1st recipe "Brisket" will be under /* Styling classes for brisket.html */. This was to help me look through the code with ease and monitor all the changes. 
- Speaking of changes, each time I finished making changes to a file, I committed it right away with a detailed message of what I did and why.

## What's Next?
The website has some basic CSS stylings now. I will be implementing advanced CSS where possible in the future.
