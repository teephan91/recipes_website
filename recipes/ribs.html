        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p><strong>3 2 1</strong> method is the most reliable way to create tender, juicy, and <em>"finger licking good"</em> ribs. The method follows these steps below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the ribs' membrane.</li>
                <li>Apply dry rub to season the ribs.</li>
                <li>Start your BBQ smoker. Get its temperature to about 225F to 250F.</li>
                <li>Throw in your wood of choices for flavour.</li>
                <li>Once your cooker is ready, it's time for the ribs. Cook them naked (without wrapping) for the <strong>first 3 hours</strong>.</li>
                <li>Remove the ribs and wrap in either foil or butcher paper. Then put the wrapped ribs back and cook for <strong>another 2 hours</strong>.</li>
                <li>Take a nap.</li>
                <li>Take the wrapped ribs out. Get rid of the wrapping. Cook them naked again for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slather the ribs with BBQ sauce. Continue cooking for another 30 minutes to finish the <strong>last hour</strong>.</li>
                <li>Remove the ribs from the cooker. And let the meat rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
