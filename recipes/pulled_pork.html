        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>Here is how you do it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Trim off some fat from the pork shoulder.</li>
                <li>Score the remaining fat in a grid pattern. This allows the rub to penetrate the meat.</li>
                <li>Rub the pork with yellow mustard. This helps the rub stick better.</li>
                <li>Apply the BBQ rub evenly.</li>
                <li>Get your smoker ready. The ideal temperature range would be 225F to 250F. This is low n slow.</li>
                <li>Place the Boston butt in the smoker.</li>
                <li>Smoke the pork until its internal temperature reaches 160F. Along the way, spritz the pork to keep it moist.</li>
                <li>When at 160F, remove the pork butt and wrap it in either paper or foil. It's your choice.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking until the pork hits 200-205F internal.</li>
                <li>Let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>With your bear claws, shred or pull the pork similar to the picture above.</li>
